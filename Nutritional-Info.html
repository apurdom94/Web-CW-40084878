  <p1>There are many aspects to living a healthy lifestyle alongside exercise nutrition plays a key role in this. Information on the internet is extremely vast and can be confusing. It is the aim of this section of the page to provide a broken down and easy to understand format. 
    There is three key areas of nutrition that are essential to development. These are known as macronutrients. The three key ones are protein, carbohydrates and fats. It is a common misconception that if someone has too many carbs or fats they will gain weight.

    If more calories are consumed weight will be gained and if less then weight will be lost. It is normal that people think this cause it is normally in the form of fat.
